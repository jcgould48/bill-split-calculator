### The Greatest Bill Split Calculator Ever Built!
***

#### Inspiration
This project was inspired by Colin Jaffe and my desire to not fail this class.

It was my first attempt at creating a basic application using Javascript.

I chose to create a bill-split-calculator because it is something that could be useful on a daily basis.

***
### Installation
To install this app please follow the following instructions:

    Go to www.Github.com

    Navigate to my world class repository -
    https://github.com/jcgould48/bill-split-calculator

    Click the link to the calculator

    Click 'Fork'

    Click 'Clone' and copy the link

    Go into your Terminal and type
    `git clone `link'

    Navigate into the directory

    Type `npm i`

Now you should be ready to access node and use the apps.  Please continue to the 'Usage' section for further instructions.
***
#### Usage
This application is fairly straight forward and only requires the use of bash and node.

Once you have in stalled the app you simply have to start Terminal, navigate to the appropriate folder containing the calculator and type in the following code:

`node bill-split-calculator.js bill-amount tip-percentage number-of-people`

An example with numbers for the variables would be:

`node bill-split-calculator.js 1000 20 5'`

Which will produce a result of $240 per person.

And this calculator is flexible!  To represent the tip percentage you can write either the whole value or the decimal.  Both will work!

So if your service was great and you wanted to leave a 25% tip on you bill you can either writ 25 or .25 in the second variable position.
