### The Greatest Bill Split Calculator Ever Built!
***

#### Inspiration
This project was inspired by Colin Jaffe and my desire to not fail this class.

It was my first attempt at creating a basic application using Javascript.

I chose to create a bill-split-calculator because it is something that could be useful on a daily basis.

***
#### Usage
This application is fairly straight forward and only requires the use of bash and node.

Once you have in stalled the app you simply have to start Terminal, navigate to the appropriate folder containing the calculator and type in the following code:

`node bill-split-calculator.js bill-amount tip-percentage number-of-people`

An example with numbers for the variables would be:

`node bill-split-calculator.js 1000 20 5'`

Which will produce a result of $240 per person.
